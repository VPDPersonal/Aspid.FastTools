# TypeSelector for SerializeReference — Step-by-Step Tutorial

A guided, hands-on tour of everything `[TypeSelector]` does for `[SerializeReference]` fields. Work through the
lessons in order: each one builds on the previous and maps to one section of the `TypeSelectorTutorial` component.

**The one rule:** put `[SerializeReference]` **and** `[TypeSelector]` on the same field. The first tells Unity to
store a polymorphic instance; the second renders the searchable type picker.

```csharp
[SerializeReference] [TypeSelector]
private IWeapon _weapon;
```

## Open the tutorial

1. Import this sample from **Package Manager → Aspid.FastTools → Samples → SerializeReferences → Import**.
2. Open **`Scenes/TypeSelectorTutorial.unity`** and select the **TypeSelector Tutorial** GameObject.
3. **Checkpoint:** the Inspector shows eight numbered sections, **STEP 1 → STEP 8**, with STEP 1 reading
   *"Single polymorphic reference"*. If you see plain foldouts without type dropdowns, the sample assembly has
   not finished compiling — wait for Unity to recompile. A few steps come pre-filled so you can see working
   examples immediately; the rest are empty for you to try.

Prefer a clean slate? Add an empty GameObject and attach the **TypeSelectorTutorial** component.

Every lesson below works in both the default **UIToolkit** inspector and the **IMGUI** inspector — the package
ships a drawer for each path and they are at feature parity. (`Prefabs/IMGUILoadout.prefab` forces the IMGUI path
if you want to compare — see *The IMGUI path* in [README.md](README.md).)

---

## Lesson 1 — Your first picker

**Field:** `IWeapon _step1Single` · `[SerializeReference] [TypeSelector]`

Click the dropdown in the field header. A searchable, hierarchical window opens listing every concrete `IWeapon`
implementation: `Sword`, `Pistol`, `Shotgun`, `Railgun`, `Crossbow`.

<!-- TODO(media): aspid_fasttools_type_selector_window.png is re-shot together with README (same shared file) -->
![The type picker window](../../Documentation/Images/aspid_fasttools_type_selector_window.png)

*The picker window (shown here on another candidate list — yours opens filtered to `IWeapon`).*

- **Pick a type** → Unity instantiates it and its own serialized fields appear inline under the foldout.
- **`<None>`** (first row) → clears the reference back to `null`.
- **Type to search** — just start typing; or click the magnifier. `↑ ↓` navigate, `Enter` selects, `Esc` closes.
- **Favourites & Recent** — hover a row and click the star, or press `Space`, to pin a type to the **Favorites**
  group. Types you pick are remembered under **Recent**. Both groups are collapsible.

> The picker only ever lists types you can actually instantiate — concrete, non-abstract classes that are not
> `UnityEngine.Object`. That filtering is automatic; you never see an invalid choice.

---

## Lesson 2 — Lists and arrays

**Field:** `List<IWeapon> _step2List` · `[SerializeReference] [TypeSelector]`

A `List<T>` (or array) of a `[SerializeReference]` type turns every element into its own independent picker.

1. Press **+**. Instead of duplicating the last element, the **picker opens** so you choose the new element's type.
2. Add a few elements and give each a different weapon — they are fully independent instances.
3. Reorder or remove elements as usual.

This is the first behaviour the attribute *changes* versus stock Unity: the native "+" would clone the previous
element (and alias its data); here "+" always appends a fresh, typed instance.

> **IMGUI note.** The UIToolkit field manages the list "+" automatically. In an IMGUI inspector Unity applies the
> `[TypeSelector]` drawer to each *element*, so it cannot reach the list's "+" — draw such lists with
> `SerializeReferenceIMGUIList.Draw(listProperty, label, elementType)` to get the same picker-backed "+" (see
> `Editor/IMGUILoadoutEditor.cs`). The per-element dropdowns need no special handling.

---

## Lesson 3 — Abstract bases and interfaces

**Field:** `StatusEffect _step3Abstract` · `[SerializeReference] [TypeSelector]`

`StatusEffect` is an **abstract** class — you cannot `new` it.

**Try it:**
1. Open the picker.
2. Note that only the concrete subclasses `BurnEffect` and `FreezeEffect` are offered.

**Notice:**
- The abstract base itself is never listed — there would be nothing to instantiate.
- An interface-typed field behaves identically (Lesson 1's `IWeapon` is an interface).
- Declare the field as the broadest type that makes sense; the picker shows only the concrete leaves you can create.

---

## Lesson 4 — Narrowing the candidate list

**Fields:** three `IWeapon` fields with different attribute arguments.

```csharp
[SerializeReference] [TypeSelector(typeof(IRanged))]            private IWeapon _step4Ranged;
[SerializeReference] [TypeSelector(typeof(IMelee))]             private IWeapon _step4Melee;
[SerializeReference] [TypeSelector(typeof(IMelee), typeof(IRanged))] private IWeapon _step4MeleeOrRanged;
```

All three fields are declared `IWeapon`, yet the picker shows different sets. The base type(s) you pass to
`[TypeSelector(...)]` act as an **extra filter, applied below the declared field type**:

| Attribute | Offered types |
|---|---|
| `[TypeSelector]` (Lesson 1) | `Sword`, `Pistol`, `Shotgun`, `Railgun`, `Crossbow` (all `IWeapon`) |
| `[TypeSelector(typeof(IRanged))]` | `Pistol`, `Shotgun`, `Railgun`, `Crossbow` |
| `[TypeSelector(typeof(IMelee))]` | `Sword` |
| `[TypeSelector(typeof(IMelee), typeof(IRanged))]` | all five (multiple base types are OR-ed) |

Use this to keep a field's *type* broad (so your code stays generic) while constraining what designers can pick.

> The base types narrow **below** the declared field type — they can never widen it. `[TypeSelector(typeof(object))]`
> on an `IWeapon` field still only shows `IWeapon` implementations.

> **Note — `TypeAllow` does not apply here.** The `Allow = TypeAllow.Abstract / Interface` option on the attribute
> only affects `[TypeSelector]` on a **`string`** field (where you are naming a type, not instantiating it). For a
> `[SerializeReference]` field it is ignored — you can never pick an abstract class or interface, because there would
> be nothing to instantiate.

---

## Lesson 5 — Nested references (recursion)

**Field:** `IWeapon _step5Nested` · `[SerializeReference] [TypeSelector]`

**Try it:**
1. Pick **`Railgun`** and expand its foldout.
2. Find its `Charge Effect` field — itself a `[SerializeReference] [TypeSelector] StatusEffect`.
3. Open *that* picker and assign a `BurnEffect` or `FreezeEffect`.

**Notice:**
- A managed reference can contain another managed reference, to any depth.
- Every nested level gets its own picker, inline child fields, notices and context-menu actions — the drawer is fully recursive.

---

## Lesson 6 — Generic hierarchies

**Fields:** `IModifier _step6Open` and `Modifier<float> _step6Closed`.

`Modifier<T>` is a **concrete open generic** (`IModifier`), with closed subclasses `DamageModifier : Modifier<float>`,
`AmmoModifier : Modifier<int>`, `NameModifier : Modifier<string>`.

**On the `IModifier` field** (`_step6Open`), the picker offers:

- the three concrete closed subclasses, **and**
- the open generic **`Modifier<T>`** itself.

Pick `Modifier<T>` and a **second page** opens to choose the argument `T`. Try `string`, then `float` — only after `T`
is resolved is the closed type (`Modifier<string>` / `Modifier<float>`) constructed and assigned.

**On the `Modifier<float>` field** (`_step6Closed`), `T` is already fixed by the field type, so:

- candidates are constrained by assignability — only `DamageModifier` (a `Modifier<float>`) and `Modifier<float>`
  itself are offered; `AmmoModifier` (int) and `NameModifier` (string) are excluded, and
- picking `Modifier<…>` builds `Modifier<float>` **directly**, with no second page.

---

## Lesson 7 — References inside `[Serializable]` containers

**Fields:** `WeaponSlot _step7Slot` and `List<WeaponSlot> _step7Slots`.

`WeaponSlot` (`Scripts/WeaponSlot.cs`) is a plain `[Serializable]` class (not a managed reference itself) holding a
`label`, a `priority`, and a `[SerializeReference] [TypeSelector] IWeapon`.

**Try it:**
1. Expand `_step7Slot` and pick a weapon for its inner field.
2. Add elements to `_step7Slots` — each element is a container whose weapon is its own picker.

**Notice:**
- A managed reference does **not** have to sit directly on the component.
- Everything you learned still applies at this depth: the picker, inline child fields, the missing-type warning and its inline **Fix**.
- It works on the component, one level inside a container, or inside each element of a `List<WeaponSlot>`.

---

## Lesson 8 — Required references

**Field:** `IWeapon _step8Required` · `[SerializeReference] [TypeSelector(Required = true)]`

Set `Required = true` on `[TypeSelector]` to mark a reference as mandatory.

```csharp
[SerializeReference, TypeSelector(Required = true)]
private IWeapon _weapon;
```

**Try it:**
1. Leave the field empty — an inline **"Required reference is not set"** warning appears.
2. Pick any `IWeapon` — the notice clears.

**Notice:**
- The same `Required = true` works on a `[TypeSelector] string` type field — there "unset" means an empty type name.
- A present-but-missing managed-reference type is never a *required* violation — it keeps its own missing-type notice.
- Required references also feed the **build / CI gate** (see *Project settings* at the end of this page).

## Power-user gestures (right-click any field above)

These are not separate fields — they are gestures available on every `[TypeSelector]` field via its right-click
context menu, header, or drag-and-drop. Try them on the fields from Lessons 1–8.

| Gesture | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Switch the type** | Keeps the fields the old and new type share. Set a `Pistol`'s damage, switch to `Shotgun` and back — the value survives (data is carried over by name). |
| **Copy / Paste Serialize Reference** | Right-click the header. Paste rebuilds an **independent** instance; it is greyed-out when the copied type does not fit the field. |
| **Make Unique Reference** | When two fields share one instance (a "shared reference" notice appears — e.g. after duplicating a list element), this gives the field its own copy so edits stop bleeding across. |
| **Link to Existing ▸ …** | The inverse: deliberately point this field at a sibling field's instance, sharing one object across both. |
| **Drag a `MonoScript` onto the field** | Drag a `.cs` script from the Project window onto the header; if its class fits (honouring the narrowing from Lesson 4) a fresh instance is assigned. |
| **Create New Script…** | Generates a `[Serializable]` class deriving from the field's base type, then auto-assigns a new instance after the recompile. |
| **Save as Template… / Paste Template ▸ …** | Save the current value as a named, project-wide template and re-apply it to any compatible field later. |
| **Find Usages of …** | Opens the Search window (`sr:<Type>`) listing every place that type is used as a managed reference. |

## Maintenance: repairing broken references

When a managed-reference type is renamed, moved or deleted, its stored data is orphaned. The tutorial ships sibling
assets **pre-broken** on purpose so you can practise the recovery flow:

- `Presets/BrokenWeaponPreset.asset`, `Presets/BrokenArsenalPreset.asset` — `ScriptableObject`s referencing a missing `GhostWeapon`.
- `Prefabs/LoadoutMissingType.prefab` — a prefab whose `Sidearms → Element 0` references a missing `GhostPistol`.
- `Presets/MovedWeaponPreset.asset` — a `ScriptableObject` whose `Weapon` still stores `Pistol` under an old `…Samples.SerializeReferences.Legacy` namespace, as if the class had been moved without a `[MovedFrom]` attribute. The type itself exists — only the stored identity is stale.
- `Presets/RenamedWeaponPreset.asset` — still stores the old `CrossbowLauncher` class name; the class now ships as `Crossbow` with a declared `[MovedFrom]`. Not broken, just stale on disk — demonstrates the **Migrate all** flow below.

### Inline repair (one field)

1. Select a broken asset **in the Project window**.
2. The missing field shows a `<Missing …>` caption, a **Missing type** warning and a **Fix** button (often with a one-click **Smart Fix** suggestion of the likely new type).
3. Click **Fix**, pick the replacement (e.g. `Pistol`) — the reference is rewritten **keeping its data** (the picker rewrites the stored type in the asset file rather than recreating the instance).

<!-- TODO(media): optional gif aspid_fasttools_serialize_reference_repair.gif — missing-type notice → Fix / Smart Fix, data preserved (shared with README) -->

### Smart Fix (one click, no picker)

The `GhostWeapon` assets above have no plausible successor, so their notice only offers the manual **Fix**. Open
`Presets/MovedWeaponPreset.asset` instead — its warning ends with a clickable **`→ Pistol?`** suggestion:

1. Hover the suggestion — the tooltip shows the full suggested identity and the ranking reason (`same type name`).
2. Click it — the reference is re-pointed at the moved `Pistol` in one step, keeping `_damage = 21`, `_magazineSize = 6`.

Ranking, highest first (the same candidate pool the picker would offer):

1. a declared `[MovedFrom]` match
2. a same-named type in another namespace/assembly
3. a casing-only rename
4. a near-miss name backed by the orphaned data's field shape

The suggestion is **never applied automatically** — you always click.

> A rename/move that ships `[MovedFrom]` from the start never breaks at all — Unity migrates the reference on load.
> Smart Fix is the safety net for the moves that forgot it. The files themselves still store the old name until each
> asset is re-saved, though — the migration flow below bakes the rename in.

### Migrate a `[MovedFrom]` rename (Project References)

`Presets/RenamedWeaponPreset.asset` stores its weapon under the old class name `CrossbowLauncher`; the class now ships
as `Crossbow` with `[MovedFrom(false, null, null, "CrossbowLauncher")]`. The Inspector shows a healthy `Crossbow` —
Unity migrates the reference **in memory** on load — but the file on disk still stores the old name: stale for version
control, YAML scans and any asset that never gets re-saved.

1. Open **`Tools → Aspid 🐍 → FastTools → Project References`** and **Scan Project**.
2. The `CrossbowLauncher` group renders as a calm, info-tinted **pending migration** — not a warning: an authoritative
   `[MovedFrom]` match is not a guess, so in place of a Smart Fix suggestion the card carries a
   **`Migrate all (1) → Crossbow`** button.
3. Click it and confirm (the dialog previews the exact YAML lines that will change). The file now stores `Crossbow`,
   keeping `_damage = 17`, `_boltCount = 5`.

Once no file in the project stores the old name, the `[MovedFrom]` attribute can be deleted from the code — migrating
is what makes that cleanup safe.

> Repair reads and rewrites the asset YAML directly, because Unity does not expose a missing type through its
> serialization API (and on GameObjects/prefabs even drops it from the live object — UUM-129100). It therefore needs a
> **saved asset file**: it works on ScriptableObjects and prefab assets selected in the Project, and on objects in
> Prefab Mode / a clean saved scene, but not on a dirty scene or a prefab-instance override.

### Whole-asset & project-wide repair

Open **`Tools → Aspid 🐍 → FastTools`**:

| Tab | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Asset References** | Maps a saved asset's entire `[SerializeReference]` graph and repairs any missing node inline — any depth, any child object the Inspector can't otherwise reach. |
| **Project References** | Sweeps every asset under `Assets/` and groups broken references **by stored type** — `BrokenWeaponPreset.asset` and `BrokenArsenalPreset.asset` collapse into one **GhostWeapon** group (`4 entries · 2 files`). **Fix all** re-points every entry across both files at once. A group whose stored type matches a declared `[MovedFrom]` shows **Migrate all** instead — see the migration section above. |

### Guard rails (no window needed)

- **Delete guard** — deleting a `.cs` whose class is still used as a managed reference pops a confirm dialog listing the affected assets before it lets the delete through.
- **Breakage toast** — when references newly become missing after a recompile, a dismissable toast and one console warning deep-link straight to the repair window. Switch it off via **Breakage detection** in Project settings (below) if you find it intrusive.

---

## Project settings

**`Project Settings → Aspid FastTools → SerializeReference`** exposes:

- **Breakage detection** — the proactive toast; per-machine.
- **Auto de-alias duplicated list elements**, **Build / CI gate** (`Off` / `Warn` / `Fail`), **Excluded scan folders** — saved to a **committed** `ProjectSettings/SerializeReferenceSharedSettings.asset` so teammates and CI behave identically.
- The same options, plus the picker's per-user preferences (Favorites, Recent capacity, appearance), also live in the window's **Settings** tab and at **`Preferences → Aspid FastTools`**.

The full reference — every setting, scope rules and the headless-CI entry point
(`SerializeReferenceCiGate.RunCheck` and its `-srGate*` flags) — lives in the package documentation:
**Documentation → SerializeReference Selector → Project settings & the build/CI gate**.

| File | Shows |
|---|---|
| `Scripts/Tutorial/TypeSelectorTutorial.cs` | All eight lessons as numbered fields |
| `Scripts/Weapons/` | `IWeapon` + `IMelee`/`IRanged` branches and `Sword`/`Pistol`/`Shotgun`/`Railgun`/`Crossbow` |
| `Scripts/Effects/` | abstract `StatusEffect` + `BurnEffect`/`FreezeEffect` |
| `Scripts/Modifiers/` | the `Modifier<T>` generic hierarchy |
| `Scripts/WeaponSlot.cs` + `Scripts/SlottedLoadout.cs` | references nested in `[Serializable]` containers (Lesson 7, standalone) |
| `Scripts/WeaponPreset.cs` + `Presets/Broken*.asset` / `Presets/MovedWeaponPreset.asset` / `Presets/RenamedWeaponPreset.asset` | the missing-type repair flow — manual **Fix**, the one-click **Smart Fix** and the `[MovedFrom]` **Migrate all** |
| `Scripts/IMGUILoadout.cs` + `Scripts/Editor/IMGUILoadoutEditor.cs` | the same fields forced through the IMGUI path (see *The IMGUI path* in [README.md](README.md)) |
